*** PLEASE NOTE ***
Rust is currently in the process of changing how furnaces work fundamentally. As a result this project will be put on pause until the changes are in effect and then rebuilt if there is still a need for it.


# Furnaust
The goal of this project is to create an android application that will assist in calculating the optimal spread and amount of ores within a furnace or oil refinery relevant to the PC game called Rust.
